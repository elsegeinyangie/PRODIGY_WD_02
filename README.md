For this very stopwatch web application, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are implemented throught this projet. 
HTML is used to structure the elements of the application. 
Multiple functions are implemented like starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as tracking and displaying lap times.
Users can accurately measure and record time intervals. With these technologies and functionalities.
I have also added for the stopwatch applicaion to be responsive in both bigger and smaller screen sizes.
